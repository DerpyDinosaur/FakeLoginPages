# Spoofed Login Pages
This repo includes a basic login page with real world examples of login pages.
These are used to demonstrate wireshark over an unencrypted network and how your information can be stolen.

Hosting these networks outside a private setting and without permission of the private network owner, is a cyber crime. I do not endorse these acts and have no problem reporting you to authorities if I understand you have been wrongfully using this repository.
