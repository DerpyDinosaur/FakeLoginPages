# Forged Login Pages
This repo includes a both basic and real world examples of login pages.
These are used to demonstrate wireshark over an unencrypted network and how your information can be stolen.

Hosting these sites outside a private network setting and without permission of the private network owner, is a cyber crime. I do not endorse these acts and have no problem reporting you to authorities if I find users have been wrongfully using this repository.
